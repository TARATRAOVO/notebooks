## UNIT THREE
My only idea of paragraph development before is to list every sentences about the topic and organize them into a paragraph, which make my writing urclear and unarranged. After watching the videos, I've learned that paragraphs can be debeloped in may different ways, including exemplification, description, narration, definition and so on. I think exemplification is the most useful because it is logicaly clear. The center of my article is often not clear because I unconsciously run away from my topic. To maintain unity of a paragraph, I need to make sure that one paragraph has only one topic or one idea and deals with only one aspect of an idea. It is really heuristic because I've never tried to concentrate on one topic in a paragraph. I prefer to write as more as possible, which make my writing redundant. From now on, I'll revise the writing and rearrange the sentences which are off the topic to another paragraph.
