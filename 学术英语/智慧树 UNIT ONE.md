## Unit one
I've never struggled with word choice because of my poor vocabulary limits my choice of words. And poor vocabulary is also one of  reasons of my boring writing. As the teacher in the video said, to get my ideas conveyed concretely and more attractively, I'd better use specific and concrete words. English is a language of rich vocabulary, there are many different way to refer to the same thing in English. It's really important for us to decide which word is proper for our writing. Suppose that I've remembered much word, so I need to use specific words to convey my ideas. General words can only give a general overview and  broad meanings of the subject. While the specific words can provide precise, sensory or concrete details. If I want to limit my elaboration to a particular idea, I'd better use specific words. It is realy resonable that sepcific words can make my writing more vivid because specific words can provide more details to the reader and express my meanings more effectively.
