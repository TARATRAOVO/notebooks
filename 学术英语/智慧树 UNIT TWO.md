## UNIT TWO
Influnced by the minimalism, I'd like to learn how to give information clearly by as few words as possible. Effecive writing should be concise and should contain no unnecessary words or phrases. Clear and concise writing save both the writer and the reader a great deal of time and makes the text more pleasant to read. To achieving the concisencess, I need to identify the extra words that weighing down my writing and tighted up wordy sentences. Firstly, I need to eliminate the needless repetition of words, sentences, paragraph and ideas which I use constantly without realizing. Redundancy not only increases the length of our writing without adding meaning, but also makes our writing harder of readers to understand. Then I need to remove the vague words and make my writing cleared and more direct. Thirdly, delete filler words can also achieve conciseness. It's easy to delete filler words by not writing in a conversational tone. When writing for academic purposes, we should write more formal and avoid conversatonal filler.
