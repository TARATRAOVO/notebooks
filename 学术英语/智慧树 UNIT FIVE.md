## UNIT FIVE
I love the note-taking skill in this paragraph best, because I've always been taking notes in the class so hard but all the note I've taken down in my notebook will end up useless. I've ever wondered that if it is necessary to take the notes. However, it seems to be a consensus that taking notes is an important part of the life of every student. After watching the video, I have to draw a conclusion that my poor note-taking skils should be responsible for my useless notes. The good notes should be accurate, clear and concise. When taking the notes, I was only write down what I've heard from the teacher's mouse with out thinking, which make my notes inaccurate and confusing.
